MCPs for Mobile
===============

MCPs for Mobile is a Kotlin project that enables control of Android devices or emulators through an AI agent. The agent
processes natural language commands and performs corresponding actions on connected Android devices—such as listing
installed apps, launching applications, and interacting with UI elements. It supports integration with local or cloud
based language models.

Features
--------

- AI-powered device control using Gemini or local models.
- Integration with ADB (Android Debug Bridge).
- Tool-based agent for device actions.
- Extensible with new tools and capabilities.
- Written in Kotlin Multiplatform for desktop execution.

Caution
-------

> [!CAUTION]
> This agent can execute ADB commands automatically in response to prompts, without confirmation. Use with care,
> especially for commands that modify app state or perform sensitive operations. Recommended for use in development
> environments or emulators.

Demo
----

Example prompt:

> Find search bar in screen, type "First video in YouTube" and send done event. Once you get search results get list in
> screen and click first element. After that tell me what did you do and what you see in the screen.
